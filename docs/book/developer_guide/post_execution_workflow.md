# Post Execution Workflow

After executing a pipeline, the user needs to be able to fetch it from history and perform certain tasks. This page 
captures these workflows at an orbital level.

### Accessing past pipeline runs

In the context of a post-execution workflow, there is an implied hierarchy of some basic ZenML components:

```shell
repository -> pipelines -> runs -> steps -> outputs

# where -> implies a 1-many relationship.
```

#### Repository

The highest level `repository` object is where to start from.

```python
from zenml.repository import Repository

repo = Repository()
```

#### Pipelines

The repository contains a collection of all created pipelines with at least one run.

```python
# get all pipelines from all stacks
pipelines = repo.get_pipelines()  

# now you can get pipelines by index
pipeline_x = pipelines[-1]

# or get one pipeline by name and/or stack key
pipeline_x = repo.get_pipeline(pipeline_name=..., stack_key=...)
```

#### Runs

Each pipeline can be executed many times. You can easily get a list of all runs like this

```python
runs = pipeline_x.runs  # all runs of a pipeline chronlogically ordered

# get the last run by index
run = runs[-1]

# or get a specific run by name
run = pipeline_x.get_run(run_name=...)
```

#### Steps

Within a given pipeline run you can now zoom in further on the individual steps.

```python
steps = run.steps  # all steps of a pipeline
step = steps[0]
print(step.entrypoint_name)
```

#### Outputs

Most of your steps will probably create outputs. You'll be able to inspect these outputs like this:

```python
# The outputs of a step
# if there are multiple outputs they are accessible by name
output = step.outputs["output_name"]

# if one output, use the `.output` property instead 
output = step.output 

# will get you the value from the original materializer used in the pipeline
output.read()  
```
